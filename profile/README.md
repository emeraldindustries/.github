# Emerald Industries

**Pragmatic tools, frameworks, and experiments.** We ship small things that punch above their weight. Use what helps; fork the rest.

> Heads‑up: a number of projects are being migrated from a personal account to this org. Expect some activity as repos move over.

---

## Highlights
- **Dorothy** — symbolic, modular PHP framework for building maintainable apps.
- **Foundry** — tooling & release automation for consistent DX.
- **Glyf** — theming, UI primitives, and design helpers.
- **Attic** — one‑off utilities published as **no‑maintenance OSS**.

> Explore all repositories on the **Repositories** tab. Pinning will highlight the most active ones.

## Where to start
- **Attic utilities** → quick scripts you can copy and run.
- **Templates** → when available, choose **Use this template** in repo headers to bootstrap a new project.
- **Discussions** → questions, tips, and ideas go to https://github.com/emeraldindustries/attic/discussions.

---

## Contributing
We prefer small, focused PRs.
- Read the repo’s `README` first; each project may have its own conventions.
- Many utilities are designed to be portable (Bash 4+, minimal deps). Please document any requirements.
- For the **Attic**, see its `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SUPPORT.md` (no‑maintenance stance).

---

## Support & Security
- Support expectations are documented per‑repo. The **Attic** is explicitly **as‑is**.
- See the org‑level `SECURITY.md` for guidance.

---

## License
Most code here is released under **MIT** unless stated otherwise. Check each repository’s `LICENSE` file.
