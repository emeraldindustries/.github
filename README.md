# Emerald Industries — Org Community Files ⚙️

Default, org-wide **community health** for all repos:
- 🧩 **Templates** — Issues & PRs (with helpful prompts)
- 🛡️ **Policies** — Security, Support, Contributing
- 👥 **CODEOWNERS** — review routing
- 🤖 **Dependabot** — safe, low-noise updates
- 🧪 **Workflow templates** — drop-in CI building blocks
- 🗂️ **Org profile** — `/profile/README.md` (shows on the org home)

> **How defaults apply:** GitHub uses these files when a repo **does not** provide its own.  
> Repos can override any file locally at any time.

## Quick start (for new repos)
1. Create the repo (public or private).
2. Add any workflows from [`workflow-templates/`](./workflow-templates/) as needed.
3. Use the default **Issue/PR templates** right away; customize later in-repo.
